WhatToWear
=========

Have you ever woken up in the morning only to be at a loss for what to wear? Do you yearn for a webapp that is:

  - Easily customizable (Enter your own wardrobe items)?
  - User Friendly (Google Accounts login)?
  - Generally Magical?

Fret no more, whattowear.com is here!

> WhatToWear is a webapp that intelligently prepares colour co-ordinated, 
> next-day outfits for its user based on the user's present wardrobe and local weather conditions.
